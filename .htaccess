# STCMS Secure Root .htaccess
#

# --- 1. Security: Block all files and directories starting with a dot ---
# This is a strong general rule that protects .git, .env, etc.
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteRule "(^|/)\." - [F]
</IfModule>


# --- 2. Security: Explicitly forbid access to sensitive directories ---
# Any direct web request to these folders will be blocked.
# This replaces the need for separate .htaccess files inside them.
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteRule ^(src|vendor|templates|pages|components|assets)/?$ - [F,NC,L]
</IfModule>


# --- 3. Routing: Pass all other requests to the public folder ---
# If a request was not blocked by the rules above, it's sent to the public folder.
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ public/$1 [L]
</IfModule>
